neural
======

My little playground for experimenting with Neural Networks.

This started as simply implementing the network presented in the first few chapters [here](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html). The main implementation of this is the class **NN**.

Since then, I've taken a stab at implementing a Convolutional Neural Network. You can find it in the class **CNN**. Thanks to [this](http://karpathy.github.io/neuralnets/) for helping me to better understand backpropagation.

If you just want to fool around, check out **NNPlayground** and **CNNPlayground**.
